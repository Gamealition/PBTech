This is a fork of the phpBB theme PBTech, for phpBB 3.2.0. Originally by [PayBas][1] and
[Sajaki][2].

This fork contains:

* Custom branding for Gamealition
* CSS support for extra BBCode (e.g. `[h1]`, `[floatimg]`, etc)
* Various CSS fixes for phpBB updates

This fork does not have any git history or progress, because I did not start from a git
repository. The changes were made to a zip distribution of PBTech over time. Sorry!

[Original README can be found here][3].
